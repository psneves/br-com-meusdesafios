# AGENTS.md

Codex working in `apps/web` should use these docs before editing:

1. `apps/web/CLAUDE.md`
2. `/CLAUDE.md`
3. `/documentation/08_UI_UX_Design_System.md`
4. `/documentation/05_API_Contracts.md`

Web changes should remain aligned with the 4 core challenge model:
- Water
- Diet Control
- Sleep
- Physical Exercise (gym/run/cycling/swim)
